# My fisrt React app that do my own

This is my first app made by myself in React. It is very simple and minimalistic.

It is an app for taking quick notes and deleting them by clicking

In this project I reinforced my knowledge with Use OnState , oNClick, onChage events,
and I tried to keep all the states in the App component
